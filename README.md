All sites owned by EU citizens or targeted towards EU citizens must comply with a crazy EU law. This law requires a dialog to be displayed to inform the users of your websites how cookies are being used. You can read more info on the legislation on [the site of the European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm#section_2).

This package provides an easily configurable view to display the message. Also included is JavaScript code to set a cookie when a user agrees with the cookie policy. The package will not display the dialog when that cookie has been set.

Spatie is a web design agency based in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-cookie-consent
```

The package will automatically register itself.

Optionally you can publish the config-file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\CookieConsent\CookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config-file:

```php
return [

    /*
     * Use this setting to enable the cookie consent dialog.
     */
    'enabled' => env('COOKIE_CONSENT_ENABLED', true),

    /*
     * The name of the cookie in which we store if the user
     * has agreed to accept the conditions.
     */
    'cookie_name' => 'laravel_cookie_consent',

    /*
     * Set the cookie duration in days.  Default is 365 * 20.
     */
    'cookie_lifetime' => 365 * 20,
];
```

## Usage

To display the dialog all you have to do is include this view in your template:

```php
//in your blade template
@include('cookieConsent::index')
```

This will render the following dialog that, when styled, will look very much like this one.

![dialog](https://spatie.github.io/laravel-cookie-consent/images/dialog.png)
 
Please be aware that the package does not provide any styling, this is something you'll need to do yourself.

When the user clicks "Allow cookies" a `laravel_cookie_consent` cookie will be set and the dialog will be removed from the DOM. On the next request, Laravel will notice that the `laravel_cookie_consent` has been set and will not display the dialog again

## Customising the dialog texts

If you want to modify the text shown in the dialog you can publish the lang-files with this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\CookieConsent\CookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="lang"
```

This will publish this file to `resources/lang/vendor/cookieConsent/en/texts.php`.

 ```php
 
 return [
     'message' => 'Please be informed that this site uses cookies.',
     'agree' => 'Allow cookies',
 ];
 ```
 
 If you want to translate the values to, for example, French, just copy that file over to `resources/lang/vendor/cookieConsent/fr/texts.php` and fill in the French translations.
 
### Customising the dialog contents

If you need full control over the contents of the dialog. You can publish the views of the package:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\CookieConsent\CookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="views"
```

This will copy the `index` and `dialogContents` view files over to `resources/views/vendor/cookieConsent`. You probably only want to modify the `dialogContents` view. If you need to modify the JavaScript code of this package you can do so in the `index` view file.

## Using the middleware

Instead of including `cookieConsent::index` in your view you could opt to add the `Spatie\CookieConsent\CookieConsentMiddleware` to your kernel:

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php

class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    protected $middleware = [
        // ...
        \Spatie\CookieConsent\CookieConsentMiddleware::class,
    ];

    // ...
}
```

This will automatically add `cookieConsent::index` to the content of your response right before the closing body tag.

## Optional: remove all cookies without consent

If you want to force your app to not set any cookies at all – even the ones used by sessions and CSRF protections – this is easy to do. Just add the `Spatie\CookieConsent\RemoveCookiesWithoutConsentMiddleware` to your kernel, at the very top of the list:

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php

class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    protected $middleware = [
        \Spatie\CookieConsent\RemoveCookiesWithoutConsentMiddleware::class,
        // ...
    ];

    // ...
}
```

This will simply remove all cookies from the response, without any further interaction from you, so long as `enabled` is `true` in your config, and the user hasn't (yet) consented to cookies being set.

> Note: This does have some potential drawbacks you should take into account. Specifically, sessions will not work without being able to set a cookie on the response, to track which session is which. This in turn means forms will also fail to submit, as there is no way to look up the correct CSRF token without a session to store it in. You can work around this by adding a `window.location.reload()` to the `consentWithCookies()` function in the `index` view file, to get a session cookie you can use. Alternately, if you want session cookies to still be set, you can place this middleware after `Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession`, so that the session cookies are added to the request after `RemoveCookiesWithoutConsentMiddleware` has already returned.

## Notice

The legislation is pretty very vague on how to display the warning, which texts are necessary, and what options you need to provide. This package will go a long way towards compliance, but if you want to be 100% sure that your website is ok, you should consult a legal expert.
