All sites owned by EU citizens or targeted towards EU citizens must comply to a crazy EU law. This law requires a dialog to be displayed to inform the users of your websites how cookies are being used. You can read more info on the legislation on [the site of the European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm#section_2).

This package provides an easily configurable view to display the message. Also included is JavaScript code to set a cookie when a user agrees with the cookie policy. The package will not display the dialog when that cookie has been set.

Spatie is a webdesign agency based in Antwerp, Belgium. You'll find an overview of all our open source projects [on our website](https://spatie.be/opensource).

## Postcardware

You're free to use this package (it's [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md)), but if it makes it to your production environment we highly appreciated you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using.

Our address is: Spatie, Samberstraat 69D, 2060 Antwerp, Belgium.

All postcards are published [on our website](https://spatie.be/en/opensource/postcards).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-cookie-consent
```

The package will automatically register itself.

Optionally you can publish the config-file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\CookieConsent\CookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config-file:

```php
return [

    /**
     * Use this setting to enable the cookie consent dialog.
     */
    'enabled' => env('COOKIE_CONSENT_ENABLED', true),

    /**
     * The name of the cookie in which we store if the user
     * has agreed to accept the conditions.
     */
    'cookie_name' => 'laravel_cookie_consent',
];
```

## Usage

To display the dialog all you have to do is include this view in your template:

```php
//in your blade template
@include('cookieConsent::index')
```

This will render the following dialog that, when styled, will look very much like this one.

![dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spatie/laravel-cookie-consent/gh-pages/images/dialog.png)
 
Please be aware that the package does not provide any styling, this is something you'll need to do yourself.

When the user clicks "Allow cookies" a `laravel_cookie_consent` cookie will be set and the dialog will be removed from the DOM. On the next request Laravel will notice that the `laravel_cookie_consent` has been set and will not display the dialog again

## Customising the dialog texts

If you want to modify the text shown in the dialog you can publish the lang-files with this command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\CookieConsent\CookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="lang"
```

This will publish this file to `resources/lang/vendor/cookieConsent/en/texts.php`.

 ```php
 
 return [
     'message' => 'Please be informed that this site uses cookies.',
     'agree' => 'Allow cookies',
 ];
 ```
 
 If you want to translate the values to for example french, just copy that file over to `resources/lang/vendor/cookieConsent/fr/texts.php` and fill in the French translations.
 
### Customising the dialog contents

If you need full control over the contents of the dialog. You can publish the views of the package:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\CookieConsent\CookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="views"
```

This will copy the `index` and `dialogContents` view files over to `resources/views/vendor/cookieConsent`. You probably only want to modify the `dialogContents` view. If you need to modify the JavaScript code of this package you can do so in the `index` view file.

## Using the middleware

Instead of including `cookieConsent::index` in your view you could opt to add the `Spatie\CookieConsent\CookieConsentMiddleware` to your kernel:

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php

class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    protected $middleware = [
        // ...
        \Spatie\CookieConsent\CookieConsentMiddleware::class,
    ];

    // ...
}
```

This will automatically add `cookieConsent::index` to the content of your response right before the closing body tag.

## Notice
The legislation is pretty very vague on how to display the warning, which texts are necessary, and what options you need to provide. This package will go a long way towards compliance, but if you want to be 100% sure that your website is ok, you should consult a legal expert.
